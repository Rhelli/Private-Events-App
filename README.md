# üéà Private Events - Associations

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

This project tasked us with building an event building site similar to that of [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/). Functionality would include:
  - The ability to create new events with a name, date and time
  - The ability to invite other users to your events
  - The ability to rsvp to events you've been invited to
  - The ability to see all your upcoming and past events you've either attended or been invited to

The clear focus here then, is on model associations.

> N.B. The invitation creation page is available to visit in this version however functionality to send invitations to other users has not yet been implemented.

## ‚öíÔ∏è The Project Brief

The specifications and the guides to the project can be found The Odin Project's [Associations](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) page.

The focus of this project is on forming the correct associations between different models. Namely, in this project, we have three main models to work with - users, events and invitations. A brief breakdown as to the associations:
  - Users can have many events as both hosts and as party attendees
  - Events can have many users as attendees
  - Invitations can have one owner and one creator.

From examining the above, it should be clear that what is therefore required is a correct use of many-to-many relationships and foreign keys.

As an additional requirement to this project (not listed on the TOP project page) is the implementation of TDD with the use of RSpec and Capybara.
